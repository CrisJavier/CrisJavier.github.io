The following text will have been created from the creative juices of myself as well as three other individuals. They are Hansen Cabanero, Justin Honda, and Kieran Kelly.

## Overview
The problem: Many students have a hard time deciding whether or not to take a certain class. Or they might be curious about a certain class and may feel intimidated or unprepared. Students do not want to waste tuition money on a class that they might not enjoy or learn from.

The solution: A class review platform that allows UH students to review and submit posted reviews of offered classes. These reviews may help students to gauge their ‘readiness’ and whether or not they feel that that class will benefit their career. These reviews include but are not limited to class content, textbooks usage and practicality. In terms of application structure and collections: the class number (class code) will serve as the primary key.

## Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:

1) Admin home page
2) Landing page
3) User home page
4) Review page (Non-admin, no need to be logged in to view)
5) Submit page (submit a review, must be logged in)

## Use case ideas

Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

1) New user goes to landing page, read summaries of how system works on said landing page
Can also register and set up profile to save classes or write reviews/ratings

2) Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.

3) User goes to landing page, chooses filters to search for classes that meet user’s requirements, reads through class page

4) User goes to landing page, logs in, searches up classes, saves classes for future viewing

5) User goes to landing page, logs in, searches for class they just finished (pass/fail), write review (anonymity optional)

6) Admin goes to landing page, logs in, finds classes no longer available and disables site from being viewable to regular users


## Beyond the basics

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

1) Option for anonymity when posting reviews as a user
2) Rating/Review system
3) Class Submit System (users are able to submit a class they want to set up a page for)
