## The Answer is Simple

Yes. It's worth it. What am I referring to you ask? Well if you had somehow missed the three associated labels with this essay, I'm referring to UI Frameworks! Take a look at the image above this body of text. Try not to look for too long, I don't want you to strain your eyes too much. Now I assume that you've done your fair share of browsing the Internet. You probably have a favorite browser too. Perchance you even frequent certain websites. Maybe you're constantly kept up with recent events because you're always reading news from one of the many news sites out there. Perhaps you essentially live on Youtube, watching various kinds of videos to entertain yourself. The point is you've likely visited at least one webpage. Now imagine if those websites looked like the image above. Are you still going to those webpages if alternatives exist?

## How to OWN the Internet with a Simple Footprint

Obviously "Owning" the Internet is very hyperbolic and unrealistic. There's no real one owner of the Internet. But you can leave a footprint with a simple webpage. But why stop at some random, one and done, barebones webpage that you made just to learn HTML and CSS? Make your footprint very defined and clear. Maybe your footprint has multiple viewers a day. Pictures of your footprint get shared with even more people. Perhaps you could even monetize your footprint. Well the first step, pun intended, would be to make your footprint aesthetically pleasing. How do we do that? Two words. UI Frameworks.

## What NOT to do & What TO do
Your website - your footprint if you hadn't gotten the analogy yet - should NOT look like the image at the top of this page.

## Do you Really Have To?

//no you dont have to learn ui frameworks to be a prospering web developer
//you can make a web page using just html example: https://medium.com/@william.b/i-built-a-raw-html-website-with-no-frameworks-heres-what-i-learned-407249be2137
//but very hard to make look good and practical
//ultimately, it's difficult to do, easier to make mistakes, mistakes wouldnt have been an issue with some sort of ui framework
//no need to make things hard for yourself
