The [UH Manoa Information and Technology Services Help Desk](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk/) is where people go to whenever they need help. People who may need help keeping access to their UH Manoa Gmail account, people who may need some assistance with something regarding Laulima, people who need any kind of software, hardware, and networking issues will call the ITS Help Desk and receive that assistance. 

I currently work among the ITS Help Desk under the title of "	Information Technology Student Assistant". While working in the help desk I will constantly be met with people who need help with things that I have never heard of before, or have experience with. As such, I am constantly in contact with a supervisor or my fellow help desk employees to work out the issue much in the same vain as top-down processing. As such, I've grown to become very knowledgable when it comes to filtering out the information that must be retained and relayed versus the information that can be left out.
